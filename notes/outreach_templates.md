**Subject:** Quick demo – AI agronomy assistant for your farmers (Hindi/Marathi)

Hi [Name],

I’m building **KrishiGPT**, an AI agronomy assistant for Indian farmers.  
It answers in Hindi/Marathi on **WhatsApp and web** and covers:

- Crop diseases & pest management (IPM-first)  
- Fertilizer schedules and spray dosage (with a dosage calculator)  
- Basic irrigation guidance and government schemes (PM‑KISAN, PMFBY, KCC)

I’m looking for 2–3 **retailers / FPOs / input companies** to run a short **10–15 day free pilot** to see if we can:

- Reduce average handle time for farmer queries  
- Standardize spray/fertilizer dosage  
- Provide 24×7 support in local language for their customers

Would you be open to a **15-minute demo** sometime this week?

Thanks,
