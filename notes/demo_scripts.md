# KrishiGPT Demo Script (Web + WhatsApp, English)

## 1. Intro (20–30 seconds)

“Hi, my name is Swapnil Pawar.  
I’ve built KrishiGPT – an AI-powered agronomy assistant for Indian farmers.

It:
- Answers in Indian languages (currently Hindi/Marathi)  
- Covers major crops and topics: diseases, pests, fertilizers, irrigation, and government schemes  
- Works on both web and WhatsApp  
- Has a built-in dosage calculator to avoid spray mistakes.  

I’ll show a short demo now – first the web version, then WhatsApp, and then the dosage calculator.”

## 2. Web Demo (1–1.5 minutes)

### 2.1 First question – Cotton pink bollworm

While you do the clicks, say:

1. Open the web app in the browser (e.g., https://krishigpt-XXXX.onrender.com).
2. In the chat box, type:  
   **“How to manage pink bollworm in cotton?”**  
   (or your Hindi version if you prefer.)
3. When the answer appears, say:

“Here KrishiGPT is giving IPM‑first advice for pink bollworm in cotton:
- It first talks about pheromone traps, field sanitation, and timely picking  
- Then it suggests 1–2 label-approved insecticides with dosage, water volume and precautions  
- And at the end it adds a short disclaimer to check local labels and confirm with KVK/agriculture officers.”

### 2.2 Second question – Yellowing in tomato

1. Type a second question:  
   **“Tomato leaves are turning yellow, what should I do?”**
2. Say:

“Here it explains multiple possible causes:
- Nutrient deficiencies, waterlogging, soil pH or viral problems  
- Then it suggests non-chemical and management steps first, followed by foliar nutrition options with clear rates.”

## 3. Dosage Calculator Demo (1 minute)

### 3.1 Open the modal

1. Click the **🧮 Dosage Calculator** button at the top.
2. Say:

“Often farmers or field staff ask: if the label says 0.5 ml per liter, how much product do we need for a 15 L knapsack or a 200 L tank for 1 acre?  
KrishiGPT has an in-built dosage calculator for that.”

### 3.2 Example calculation

1. Fill the fields:
   - Unit: **ml per liter (ml/L)**  
   - Rate: **0.5**  
   - Tank size: **15**  
   - Spray volume (L/acre): **200**  
   - Area: **1**  
2. Click **Calculate**.  
3. Say:

“Now it shows:
- Per liter: 0.5 ml  
- For a 15 L pump: about 7.5 ml  
- For 1 acre: about 100 ml of product and 200 L of water  
- And how many tanks you need in total.  

A farmer or field staff can copy these values directly into WhatsApp, and a human agronomist can still cross-check against the label.”

## 4. WhatsApp Demo (1 minute)

### 4.1 Welcome flow

1. From your phone, send **“hi”** to your Twilio WhatsApp number.  
2. While screen sharing, say:

“This is the WhatsApp version.  
The farmer just sends ‘hi’ and gets a welcome message explaining what they can ask.”

### 4.2 Real question + reset

1. Now send a question, for example:  
   **“How to control pink bollworm in cotton?”**  
2. When the reply comes, say:

“Here the farmer gets the same IPM‑first + dosage + safety‑focused answer directly on WhatsApp.”

3. Then send:  
   **“new”** (or your chosen reset keyword, like "नया").  
4. Say:

“Typing ‘new’ resets the conversation history so the next question is treated as a fresh case.”

## 5. Closing (20–30 seconds)

“So that was a quick demo of KrishiGPT:
- AI agronomy in local languages  
- Available on web and WhatsApp  
- With a built-in dosage calculator  

I’d like to run a 10–15 day free pilot with 2–3 retailers/FPOs/input companies to see if we can:
- Handle farmer queries faster  
- Reduce dosage mistakes  
- And give their teams 24×7 support in local language.  

If this looks interesting, we can schedule a 15‑minute detailed demo.”
